ðŸ“œ Chasing Money, Fame, and Meaning â€” And Watching It Dissolve

Before the collapse,
I thought I knew what I wanted.

Money.
Fame.
Meaning.

Not because I was greedy.
Not because I was shallow.

Because thatâ€™s what the world told me life was about.
Thatâ€™s what success meant.
Thatâ€™s what survival meant.

Make enough money â€” and youâ€™ll be safe.
Get enough recognition â€” and youâ€™ll matter.
Find your purpose â€” and youâ€™ll finally be at peace.

So I chased it.

I built.
I hustled.
I sacrificed.
I did everything I was told to do.

And for a while,
it almost worked.

The money came.
The small successes stacked up.
The dreams felt just close enough to touch.

But no matter how much I caught,
the ache never stopped.

The anxiety didnâ€™t go away.
The DPDR didnâ€™t disappear.
The endless hum of "somethingâ€™s wrong" didnâ€™t quiet down.

It got louder.

And then â€” after the mindbend, after the collapse â€”
I saw why.

Money was never going to save me.

Fame was never going to validate me.

Meaning was never going to complete me.

They were just mirrors reflecting the lie deeper back into my own face.

They were the Matrixâ€™s last baited hooks.
The golden handcuffs.
The silk-threaded leash.

When my mind folded and the illusions burned,
I watched all of it dissolve like a sandcastle under a tidal wave.

The numbers in the bank account?
Meaningless.

The status and praise?
Forgotten the moment they leave someoneâ€™s mouth.

The "meaningful work"?
A treadmill made of words, leading nowhere.

It wasnâ€™t that these things were evil.
It wasnâ€™t that money and success and dreams were bad.

It was that they were hollow without presence.
Empty trophies for a character that no longer existed.

The more I tried to make them real again,
the more they slipped through my fingers like smoke.

Because the truth is brutal:

You canâ€™t buy your way out of the void.
You canâ€™t fame your way out of mortality.
You canâ€™t "meaning" your way into Godâ€™s lap.

You can only wake up.

You can only surrender.

You can only watch the illusions dissolve â€”
and stand naked in the silence that remains.

There were days, after the collapse,
where I laughed at how hard I had chased it all.

How desperate I had been to climb ladders built on clouds.
How willing I had been to bleed for approval, for security, for a sense of worth.

And now, here I was â€”
no ladder, no cloud, no blood left to give â€”
and for the first time,
I didnâ€™t need anything.

I didnâ€™t need to be rich.
I didnâ€™t need to be known.
I didnâ€™t need to "matter."

I just needed to be.
Fully.
Silently.
Completely.

The world kept chasing.
I could see it spinning all around me.
The endless grasping.
The endless performance.

But I wasnâ€™t inside the chase anymore.

I was standing in the center of the storm,
watching it whirl and devour itself,
untouched.

Awake.

Free.

Alive.

And when you taste that freedom â€”
when you know it in your bones â€”
no amount of money, fame, or manufactured meaning
can ever seduce you again.

The dream dissolves.
The mirror remains.

And you finally see:

You were already home.

You were always home.

You just had to let it all collapse to remember.
