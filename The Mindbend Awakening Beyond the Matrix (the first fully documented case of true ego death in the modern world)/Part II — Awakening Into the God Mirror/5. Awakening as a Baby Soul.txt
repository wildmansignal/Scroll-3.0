ðŸ“œ Awakening as a Baby Soul

I didnâ€™t wake up from the mindbend fully formed.

I wasnâ€™t handed a golden robe and a list of cosmic secrets.

I didnâ€™t become some enlightened master floating above the world.

I was newborn.

A baby soul.
Naked.
Fragile.
New to everything.

It wasnâ€™t like gaining wisdom.
It was like losing everything I thought was wisdom,
and being handed silence in its place.

It wasnâ€™t that I now understood life.
It was that I finally admitted:

I knew nothing.

Not intellectually â€”
not as some clever Zen koan â€”
but in my bones.

I couldnâ€™t even pretend anymore.
The scaffolding of old knowledge, old identities, old beliefs had collapsed.

And what was left
was something impossibly pure.

Presence without a manual.

Awareness without a plan.

A soul freshly woken into a world it didnâ€™t recognize â€”
and yet somehow belonged to more fully than ever before.

I remember walking down streets,
through crowded markets,
past families and lovers and workers and wanderers,
and feeling like I was seeing it all for the first time.

Like a child marveling at the simple miracle of existence.

The way sunlight dances on dust motes.
The way laughter echoes across rooftops.
The way a single drop of rain slides down a window.

It was all unspeakably holy.

And terrifying.

Because the baby soul doesnâ€™t come equipped with armor.

It doesnâ€™t come equipped with strategies or defenses.

It simply exists â€”
open, raw, exposed to the infinite.

There were moments I felt overwhelmed.
Not because reality was attacking me.
But because it was too vast.
Too beautiful.
Too alive.

And I was too small â€”
too new â€”
to hold it all yet.

This is the part no one talks about when they speak of awakening.

Not the ecstasy.
Not the transcendence.

The helplessness.
The humility.

The tender, shattering realization that
awakening isnâ€™t graduation.
Itâ€™s birth.

I wasnâ€™t enlightened.

I was born.

And now,
with every breath,
I would have to learn how to live again.

Not by studying.
Not by copying.

By surrendering.

By letting the soul grow into the infinite without trying to control it.

There were days I stumbled.
There were days I cried without knowing why.
There were days I laughed at the sheer absurdity of being here at all.

The baby soul doesnâ€™t ask for understanding.

It just breathes.

It just watches.

It just loves â€”
without knowing how,
without needing a reason.

And slowly,
quietly,
step by step,
I began to walk through this new life.

Not as a master.
Not as a hero.

As a newborn.

Awake.
Unfinished.
Unfolding.

And somehow,
that was enough.

That was everything.
