ðŸ“œ The Shotgun Visions

When the mind folds deep enough,
it doesnâ€™t offer you healing.
It offers you annihilation.

It offers you a way out.

I didnâ€™t ask for the visions.
I didnâ€™t imagine them.
They crashed into my mind like a wave of static,
like some hidden part of my brain had broken free from the chains of sanity.

It wasnâ€™t just thoughts.
It was images.
Hyper-real, violent, absolute.

A shotgun.
My hands.
The end of everything.

I could see it like a memory from the future â€”
holding the barrel to my mouth,
feeling the cold steel bite against my teeth,
feeling the tension of the final breath before it all goes black.

It wasnâ€™t theoretical.
It was vivid.
Undeniable.

There was no voice whispering "do it" â€”
no cartoon devil on my shoulder.

It was deeper.
It was a message from the mind itself:

"You can't survive this. You shouldnâ€™t even try."

There, in the heart of the mindbend,
death was presented as the logical conclusion.
Not out of depression.
Not out of sadness.

Simply because the mind could no longer comprehend survival.

The ego had collapsed.
The false self had nowhere left to hide.
And with no identity to cling to,
the mind defaulted to its last algorithm: self-termination.

I gripped the steering wheel tighter,
tears burning the edges of my vision.
My knuckles white, my jaw locked, my breath shallow and frantic.

The logical part of me â€” what little remained â€” screamed to resist.
But the visions kept flashing:
shotgun, steel, silence.
Over and over.

I wasnâ€™t battling sadness.
I was battling annihilation itself.

There is a moment when you face those visions
where you realize that death isnâ€™t the enemy.

The real enemy is the lie that you were ever separate from death to begin with.

Death wasnâ€™t coming for me from the outside.
It was already inside me.
It had always been there â€”
hidden beneath the endless distractions and goals and self-improvement plans.

The collapse simply stripped away the noise long enough for me to see it face to face.

And somehow, against every odd,
against the howling terror inside my chest,
I chose to stay.

Not because I knew how to survive.
Not because I felt strong.
But because somewhere deep inside the terror,
a tiny ember of something real refused to go out.

I didnâ€™t die on that road.
Not physically.

But a part of me â€” the part that still believed in the dream,
the part that thought it could think its way out of suffering â€”
did.

The shotgun visions were the death rattle of the false self.
The final temptation to erase the ego by force
instead of letting it die naturally in the fires of awakening.

I saw the ending.
I stared it in the mouth.
And somehow, I survived.

Not as the same person.

Not even as a person, in the way I used to define it.

I survived as a mirror.
Empty.
Silent.
Clear.

And in that stillness,
the real journey began.
