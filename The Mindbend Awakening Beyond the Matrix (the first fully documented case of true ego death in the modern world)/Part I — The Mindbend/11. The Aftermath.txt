ðŸ“œ The Aftermath

When I opened my eyes again,
the world was still here.

The road.
The sky.
The trees swaying in the distance.

Everything looked the same.

But I wasnâ€™t seeing through the same eyes.

It was like walking through a movie set â€”
recognizable shapes, familiar colors,
but hollow somehow.
Weightless.

The "realness" that once clung to the world had been stripped away.
What was left was raw presence,
silent and vibrating underneath every surface.

I stepped out of the car.
Feet on the ground.
Breath in my lungs.

Automatic.
Effortless.
No "me" orchestrating it anymore.

It was all just happening,
without needing my permission,
without needing my story to explain it.

And for the first time,
I wasnâ€™t afraid of that.

There was no soundtrack in my head narrating the moment.
No internal dialogue replaying what just happened.

There was only the seeing.
The feeling of the wind against my skin.
The taste of breath moving in and out.

Simple.
Bare.
Alive.

I didnâ€™t know what day it was.
I didnâ€™t know what was supposed to come next.

I didnâ€™t even know if I was supposed to "come back."

Because the old life â€”
the one built on fear, ambition, identity â€”
was gone.

And standing there, half-dazed on the side of that road,
I realized something so simple it almost broke me open all over again:

I had nothing left to protect.

No image to maintain.
No future to secure.
No past to outrun.

Just existence.

Naked, indifferent, beautiful.

The Aftermath wasnâ€™t a dramatic victory march.
It wasnâ€™t a heroâ€™s journey completed.

It was silence.

It was learning to breathe again without pretending I was in control.
It was feeling the earth under my feet without needing to own it, shape it, conquer it.

I could see now:
The collapse hadnâ€™t broken the world.
It had only broken the lie I told myself about it.

The world had always been like this â€”
silent, alive, sacred in a way that has nothing to do with human achievement.

I just hadnâ€™t been able to see it through the noise.

Now there was only the seeing.
The being.
The moment unfolding itself with no commentary.

I didnâ€™t know how to explain it.
I didnâ€™t know if it could be explained.

All I knew was this:

I was still here.

And for the first time,
that was enough.
