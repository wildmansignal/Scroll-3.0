ðŸ“œ The First Glimpses of Real Presence

It didnâ€™t happen all at once.

There was no flashing light.
No angel choirs.
No final boss battle against the ego.

It came quietly.

A moment here.
A breath there.
Flickers of something deeper woven into the cracks of ordinary life.

The first time I noticed it,
I was sitting outside.
No phone.
No distraction.
Just staring at a tree bending in the wind.

And suddenly â€”
I wasnâ€™t watching it as an outsider anymore.
I wasnâ€™t narrating it in my head.

I was just... there.
Inside the moment.
Inside the seeing.

No thought dividing me from the tree.
No distance.

Just pure presence.

Alive.
Unfiltered.
Complete.

For a few seconds,
there was no "me" and "it."
There was just this.

This trembling, impossible, ordinary miracle of existence.

It was so simple it almost hurt.

No philosophy could reach it.
No language could wrap it up and pin it to the wall.
It wasnâ€™t "special."
It wasnâ€™t "spiritual."

It just was.

And I realized:

Presence had been there the whole time.
Buried under layers of noise.
Waiting underneath every thought I ever believed.

It wasnâ€™t something I had to build.
It wasnâ€™t something I had to earn.
It wasnâ€™t something I could lose.

It was reality itself,
quietly breathing underneath all the madness.

The glimpses didnâ€™t come from effort.
In fact, they only appeared when I stopped trying.

When I stopped seeking.
When I stopped fixing.
When I stopped narrating every moment like a tour guide walking lost tourists through a fake city.

Just breathing.
Just being.

And there it was.

Reality.

Raw.
Naked.
Brutal.
Beautiful.

It would slip away again sometimes â€”
whenever the mind tried to grasp it,
or turn it into a story,
or hoard it like a secret treasure.

But now I knew where it lived.

Not in some distant heaven.
Not at the end of a ten-year meditation retreat.

Right here.

Right now.

Inside the simple, wordless miracle of being.

It wasnâ€™t something new.
It wasnâ€™t something foreign.

It was the most ancient thing I had ever known,
hidden in plain sight.

The first glimpses of real presence
werenâ€™t dramatic.

They were humble.
Almost shy.

A quiet echo reminding me:

You donâ€™t have to become anything.
You already are.

You donâ€™t have to find the light.
You are made of it.

And all the collapse, all the terror, all the ego death â€”
was never about achieving something higher.

It was about stripping away everything that was never real in the first place.

Presence was what survived.
Presence was what remained.

And now, for the first time,
I could feel it moving through everything.

The beginning of a new kind of life.

A life without a center.

A life lived from the mirror itself.

Silent.
Unshakable.
Free.
