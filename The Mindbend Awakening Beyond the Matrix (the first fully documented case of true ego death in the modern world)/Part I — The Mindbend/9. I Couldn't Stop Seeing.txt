I Couldn't Stop Seeing

After the mindbend,
there was no switch to flip.

There was no way to go back to sleep.

I couldn’t stop seeing reality.

It was constant.
Unrelenting.
Everywhere.

Not just when I meditated.
Not just when I thought about it.
Not just in beautiful moments.

It was everything.

It was the way sunlight burned through dirty windows.
It was the way the pavement cracked beneath my feet.
It was the hollow sound of voices echoing down grocery store aisles.
It was the sky stretching above the city like a silent witness.

Everywhere I turned,
I could see through the dream.

The Matrix hadn’t disappeared.
But it had become transparent.
Like a movie playing on thin fabric —
and behind the flickering images,
the raw immensity of real existence pulsed and waited.

I couldn't turn it off.

I couldn't distract myself.

No phone.
No drink.
No video.
No conversation.
Nothing could hide it anymore.

The silence was always there.
The presence was always there.

It hummed underneath everything —
like an ancient, invisible song
playing at a frequency just outside the range of normal minds.

Sometimes I tried to pretend.
Just for a few minutes.
To act like a normal person.
To get caught up in some small irritation or pointless distraction.

But even when I tried —
even when I fought to lose myself again —
the stillness would rise up behind the noise,
like a mountain emerging from shallow mist.

Unmoving.
Unignorable.
Absolute.

Reality wasn't letting me go.

It wasn't a dream I could wake up from.

It was the dream that had ended —
and the real had seized me like a current too strong to swim against.

And here’s the strangest part:

It wasn't exhausting.

It was vast.
It was endless.
It was overwhelming sometimes.
But it wasn’t hostile.

It didn’t ask anything from me.
It didn’t want me to achieve anything.
It didn’t punish or reward me.

It just was.

It just is.

And now —
so was I.

Seeing reality doesn’t mean understanding it.
It doesn’t mean controlling it.
It doesn’t mean escaping suffering or sadness.

It means breathing inside it.
Being stitched into it with no exit.

It means being seen by life as much as seeing it.

And after the collapse, after the mindbend, after everything burned away —

I realized:

I wasn’t trapped in reality.

I was reality.

And there was nowhere left to hide.
