Chapter 10 — Exiled Into Paradise

After the collapse,
after surviving the mindbend,
I didn’t immediately run toward the light.

I ran to the doctor.

Because that’s what you’re supposed to do, right?

When the mind feels broken,
when the world feels like a dream you can’t wake up from,
you go to someone in a white coat and ask them to fix you.

They listened.
They nodded.
They wrote me a prescription for SSRIs.

"Just take these.
You’ll feel better in a few weeks."

I wanted to believe them.

I wanted to believe there was still a chemical solution to what had happened to me.
That I was just sick, not shattered.

So I took the pills.
I waited.

And if anything —
I felt worse.

The medications didn’t make the terror go away.
They didn’t rebuild the self I had lost.
They just blurred the edges of reality even more,
turning the mindbend into a slow-motion nightmare I couldn’t wake up from.

I sat around the house for months, drinking.
Not partying.
Not numbing the pain in a way that felt rebellious or wild.

Just sitting.
Just drinking.
Just trying to exist long enough to make it to the next day.

I lived like a ghost in my own skin.
Sometimes staring at walls for hours.
Sometimes laughing at nothing.
Sometimes wondering if I had already died and just hadn’t realized it yet.

Six months blurred into one long drunken afternoon.
Sunlight sliding across the floor.
Empty bottles stacking up like forgotten prayers.

I wasn’t suicidal anymore.
That moment had passed.

But I wasn’t living, either.

I was just... hanging around.
Suspended in a haze of confusion and broken time.

Until one day —
with no real plan, no grand realization —
I booked a plane ticket.

I didn’t even really choose it.
It felt like something moving through me,
picking up my hand, typing in the credit card number,
saying:

"If you're going to drift, drift somewhere beautiful."

I landed in the Philippines a few weeks later.

And for the next two months,
I wandered the islands like a drunk ghost.

Beaches.
Bars.
Open roads.
Empty hostels.
Random street corners where the stars looked close enough to grab.

I drank.
I slept on floors.
I floated through towns where no one knew my name,
and for the first time, it didn’t bother me.

Because I didn’t have a name anymore.
Not really.

The self that once needed to be seen, needed to be validated, needed to be saved —
was dead.

What was left didn’t need to be understood.
It didn’t need to heal.

It just moved.

Through water.
Through crowds.
Through blinding sunlight and monsoon rains.

Sometimes I cried,
though not because I was sad.

Sometimes I laughed,
though not because anything was funny.

I wasn’t trying to "find myself" anymore.
I wasn’t trying to find anything.

I was just... there.
Carried by the wind.

Exiled into paradise.
Drifting not to escape pain —
but because there was no longer anywhere to "arrive."

Life kept happening.

And for once,
I let it happen without needing to turn it into a story.
