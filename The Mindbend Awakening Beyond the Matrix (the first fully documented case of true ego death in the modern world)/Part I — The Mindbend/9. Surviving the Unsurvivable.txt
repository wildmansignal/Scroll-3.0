ðŸ“œ Surviving the Unsurvivable

When the storm passed,
I was still here.

I donâ€™t know how.

I wasnâ€™t supposed to survive it.
Not physically, not mentally, not spiritually.

By every definition,
by every textbook written by psychiatrists and spiritual gurus alike,
I should have been broken beyond repair.

Collapsed into madness.
Vanished into suicide.
Locked away behind white padded walls and forgotten.

Because what happened to me was not a panic attack.
It wasnâ€™t an identity crisis.
It wasnâ€™t a "dark night of the soul."

It was total ego annihilation.
It was exposure to the raw infinite without preparation, without defense.

It was standing naked in the presence of eternity itself â€”
without a map,
without a savior,
without a single familiar thing left to cling to.

And yet â€”
I survived.

But not as who I was.

The "me" who lived his life chasing success,
fearing death,
building mental structures to feel safe â€”
that "me" didnâ€™t make it through.

He died somewhere back there,
on that road,
in that mindbend,
in that silent baptism of oblivion.

What survived wasnâ€™t a rebuilt version of the old self.
It wasnâ€™t a stronger ego, smarter and more resilient.

It was something else entirely.

Presence.

Stillness.

The empty mirror.

It wasnâ€™t that "I" had survived.
It was that survival itself had shifted.

Life wasnâ€™t happening "to me" anymore.
Life was just happening.

And what remained was simple, bare, undeniable awareness.

I was breathing.
But I wasnâ€™t the one doing it.

I was seeing.
But I wasnâ€™t the one seeing.

Reality was unfolding on its own,
effortlessly,
without a character in the center trying to control it.

And somehow, in that pure unfolding,
there was peace.

Not the peace of accomplishment.
Not the peace of figuring it out.

The peace of absence.
The peace of nothing left to chase, nothing left to protect.

I didnâ€™t have to "hold on" to survive.
Holding on was over.
There was nothing left to hold.

I wasnâ€™t surviving in the old way anymore â€”
scraping by, managing the symptoms of existence.

I was surviving simply because
life itself doesnâ€™t need a self to keep flowing.

The sun didnâ€™t ask for my identity to rise.
The breath didnâ€™t ask for my permission to enter my lungs.
The world didnâ€™t collapse just because I had.

In fact â€”
the world had never needed "me" at all.

And that realization didnâ€™t bring despair.

It brought freedom.

The unspeakable, holy freedom of knowing
you were never the one holding the universe together anyway.

And you never had to be.

I didnâ€™t climb out of the mindbend victorious.
I didnâ€™t emerge as a hero of my own story.

There was no story left.

There was just awareness,
moving through the shell of a body,
watching life bloom and dissolve with no resistance.

And that was enough.

Surviving the unsurvivable wasnâ€™t about strength.
It wasnâ€™t about faith.
It wasnâ€™t about skill.

It was about surrender.

And somehow, in the absence of everything,
life kept singing.

And I could finally hear the song.
