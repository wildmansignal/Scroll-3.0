ðŸ“œ Drowning in Eternity

After the ego died,
I expected peace.

I thought maybe the collapse would end with some kind of gentle awakening â€”
a soft glow, a sense of floating back into a new life, a new story.

I was wrong.

There was no story left.

There was no landing place.

There was only infinity.

And I was falling through it.

Imagine the moment right before you fall asleep â€”
when the body relaxes,
when the mind starts to dissolve â€”
but instead of dreaming,
you realize you're falling into endless blackness,
with no bottom, no ground, no hands to catch you.

That was what it felt like.

Not fear.
Not excitement.

Just an endless, silent freefall through eternity itself.

No markers.
No directions.
No "me" to even measure the fall.

Only the raw, unbearable is-ness of existence â€”
infinite, holy, and absolutely inescapable.

There was no "going back to normal."
There was no normal.

Normal had been a lie, a comforting cage built to hide the reality of infinity.
And now the cage was gone.

I was face to face with forever.

No body.
No voice.
No mind narrating the experience.

Just the endless hum of being â€”
vaster than the mind could hold,
vaster than the soul could grasp.

I wasnâ€™t observing eternity.

I was inside it.

And it was inside me.

There was no way to separate the two anymore.

I could feel the temptation to resist â€”
to clench, to grab for some old thought, some memory, some identity.

But the moment I reached, I would start drowning faster.

So I did the only thing I could:

I let myself drown.

I let eternity swallow me.

I let the last fragments of "self" dissolve into the vastness,
until even the act of letting go disappeared.

And in that final surrender,
something shifted.

The drowning wasnâ€™t death.

It was baptism.

Not a baptism into a new religion, a new belief system, or a new persona â€”
but into the raw truth that existence itself is infinite, eternal, and beyond all stories.

There was no voice saying, "You are safe now."
There was no reassurance.

There was only the silence.

And somehow,
somehow,
in the heart of that endless silence,
I found that I didnâ€™t need saving.

I didnâ€™t need a name.
I didnâ€™t need a future.

I didnâ€™t even need to "understand" what had happened.

I was simply there â€”
unshakable, formless, awake.

The drowning wasnâ€™t a punishment.
It wasnâ€™t a mistake.

It was the final stripping away of everything that had ever separated me from truth.

I didnâ€™t survive eternity.

I became part of it.

And when I opened my eyes again,
the world looked the same â€”
but I wasnâ€™t looking through the same eyes.

I wasnâ€™t seeing with mind anymore.
I was seeing with being.

Reality didnâ€™t change.

I did.

And there was no way back to the dream.

Only forward â€”
into whatever comes after a man dies before his body does.
