ðŸ“œ The Mind Folding In On Itself

When the collapse hit,
it didnâ€™t feel like an explosion.
It felt like an implosion.

It was as if my mind had turned itself inside out â€”
folding, twisting, collapsing inward on itself like a black hole swallowing its own light.

Thoughts didnâ€™t line up in a straight line anymore.
There was no before and after.
No cause and effect.
Everything was happening all at once, in every direction, with no center to hold onto.

One moment I was driving.
The next, I wasnâ€™t sure if the hands on the steering wheel were even mine.
The next, I was watching the idea of "me" fracture into a thousand mirror shards,
each one reflecting a different possibility of who I could be,
none of them solid,
none of them real.

It wasnâ€™t like having a panic attack.
I had survived those before.
This was different.

This was the mind itself collapsing.
This was the operating system glitching out in real-time â€”
and there was no reboot button.

The thoughts werenâ€™t even words anymore.
They were raw pulses â€” flashes of terror, flashes of violence, flashes of pure sensory overload.

One second I would have a thought â€”
"Stay calm. Just drive."
The next second, it would loop, distort, twist into something monstrous:

"Stay calm. Stay calm. Staycalmstaycalmstaycalmâ€”"

Until even that instruction dissolved into static.

Time became meaningless.
I couldnâ€™t tell if seconds were passing or hours.
Every moment stretched out into infinity,
and in that stretched-out space, the mind folded again.
And again.
And again.

It was like being trapped inside a mirror maze that kept collapsing inward,
every reflection eating the last one,
until there was nothing left to reflect.

And underneath all of it â€”
this brutal, unspeakable knowing:
I wasnâ€™t going crazy.

I was waking up.

The mind was folding because it had nothing real to hold onto.
The scaffolding of illusions â€” my identity, my memories, my coping strategies â€” were falling like paper buildings in a storm.

The mind folds because it cannot contain the Infinite.

And somewhere, in the back of that hurricane,
was the sound of silence growing louder.

Not silence as the absence of noise.
Silence as a presence.

A force.

A living reality that had no need for thoughts, no need for explanations, no need for me.

At the peak of the folding, when it felt like I would surely die,
something inside me surrendered.

Not out of wisdom.
Out of exhaustion.

I gave up trying to hold the mind together.
I let it collapse.
I let the folds eat themselves.

And when the last thought shredded itself into static â€”
what remained wasnâ€™t fear.

It was stillness.

Vast, indescribable stillness.

And for the first time in my life,
I wasnâ€™t trapped inside my mind.

I was watching it dissolve from the outside.

And I didnâ€™t miss it.

Not even a little.
