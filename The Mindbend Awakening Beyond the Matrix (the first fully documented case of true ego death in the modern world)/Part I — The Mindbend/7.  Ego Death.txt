ðŸ“œ Ego Death

After the visions burned themselves out,
after the mind folded and folded until there was nothing left to collapse,
what remained was silence.

Not a peaceful silence.
Not a victorious silence.

A hollow, cosmic silence â€”
the kind that makes even death feel small.

I wasnâ€™t thinking anymore.
I wasnâ€™t feeling in any familiar way.
I was floating in a void without a body,
without a name,
without a single tether back to the life I once knew.

I didnâ€™t know who I was.
I didnâ€™t know what I was.
I didnâ€™t know if I was.

There was no anchor to grasp,
no prayer to say,
no mantra to chant that could save me.

I had crossed the event horizon.

Ego death is not poetic.
Itâ€™s not a mystical high to brag about on the internet.
Itâ€™s the obliteration of everything you thought was real.

Itâ€™s the unbearable revelation that you were never who you thought you were.
Not a person.
Not a personality.
Not even a mind.

I wasnâ€™t Dan, or Wildman, or a survivor anymore.

I was nothing.

And in that nothingness,
for the first time,
I felt a presence that had nothing to do with "me" at all.

It wasnâ€™t that I had become something.
It was that the illusion of being "someone" had been peeled away.

All that remained was awareness itself â€”
silent, infinite, unshaken.

It didnâ€™t comfort me.
It didnâ€™t speak to me.
It didnâ€™t "welcome me home."

It just was.

It had always been there.
Waiting underneath the noise, underneath the striving, underneath the desperate need to exist.

The ego had been a storm.
The ego death was the clearing of the skies.

And now â€” for the first time â€”
there was only endless blue.

No past.
No future.
No self to carry the weight of either.

Just now.
Just presence.

The terror didnâ€™t survive the crossing.
The questions didnâ€™t survive the crossing.
Even the craving for answers dissolved in the silence.

I didnâ€™t conquer death.
I didnâ€™t transcend it.

I became so empty that even death had nowhere to land.

This is the part no one tells you:
When you die before you die,
thereâ€™s nothing left to fear.

Because thereâ€™s no one left inside to be afraid.

The old me â€” the anxious, striving, terrified mind â€” was gone.
Like a sandcastle when the tide comes in.

What replaced it wasnâ€™t a better version.
It was absence.

And in that absence â€”
life itself began to glow.

Not as something I could possess.
Not as something I could control.

But as something I was.

And in that first raw glimpse,
I realized:
the collapse wasnâ€™t a failure.

It was a birth.

Not of a new identity.
But of the truth that was always waiting underneath all the noise:

I Am.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
And nothing else.
