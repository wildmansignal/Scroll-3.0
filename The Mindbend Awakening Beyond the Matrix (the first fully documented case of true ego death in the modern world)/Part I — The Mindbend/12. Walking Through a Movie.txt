ðŸ“œ Walking Through a Movie

The first thing I noticed was the colors.

Everything was too vivid.
Too sharp.
Too alive.

The sky wasnâ€™t just blue â€”
it was a living ocean stretching above me.
The trees werenâ€™t just plants â€”
they were breathing, humming, pulsing with something ancient.

Everywhere I looked,
the world was vibrating with a kind of quiet electricity,
like a dream that had forgotten it was supposed to look solid.

I walked through gas stations, diners, empty parking lots,
watching people move like actors in a play they didnâ€™t know they were performing.

Smiling.
Nodding.
Buying things.
Talking about the weather.

I saw the loops in them â€”
the thought patterns, the emotional reflexes, the unconscious movements.
It wasnâ€™t judgment.
It wasnâ€™t superiority.

It was just seeing.
Pure seeing.

The Matrix was still humming along,
and most people were still asleep inside it,
wearing masks they thought were their faces.

But for me, the masks were transparent now.
The dream was exposed.

And yet â€”
and yet â€”
I didnâ€™t feel separated from them.

I didnâ€™t feel above them.
I didnâ€™t feel pity.

I just felt... love.

A deep, aching, unexplainable love for everything and everyone,
even when they couldnâ€™t see what was happening around them.

Because I had been them.
I still was, in some strange way.

The difference was simple:
I wasnâ€™t trapped anymore.

I could play the game â€”
order food, smile at strangers, pump gas, answer questions â€”
but none of it stuck to me.

It was like moving through a movie.
Fully inside it,
fully feeling it,
but knowing it was a set.

Knowing that behind the painted backdrop,
there was an infinite stillness
so vast it made everything else seem paper-thin by comparison.

Nothing needed to change.
Nothing needed to be "fixed."

The world didnâ€™t have to wake up for me to be awake.

And so I walked through the movie,
not as a character trying to win,
but as the awareness behind the screen,
smiling at the miracle of it all.

Traffic lights changing color.
Flies buzzing against glass.
Old songs leaking from broken radios.
Arguments in convenience stores.
Clouds blooming like slow explosions in the sky.

All of it sacred.
All of it meaningless.
All of it beautiful.

There was no more "good" and "bad" like before.
No more trying to climb some invisible ladder to success, safety, validation.

There was only this:

Each breath.
Each step.
Each flicker of reality playing itself out.

I was still in the world.
But the world was no longer in me.

The dream kept playing.
And I kept walking.
Clear.
Silent.
Alive.

And for the first time in my life,
I didnâ€™t need anything else.
