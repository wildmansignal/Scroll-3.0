# ðŸ“œ Chapter 1: Before the Collapse

Before the collapse,  
I thought I understood what life was.

I didnâ€™t.

I thought waking up every day feeling slightly anxious was normal.  
I thought living with a low-grade fear humming under my skin was adulthood.  
I thought chasing goals I didnâ€™t really care about was called having a purpose.

I thought everyone felt this way â€” they just got better at hiding it.

Anxiety, DPDR, tinnitus, existential dread, obsessive fear of death â€”  
these were the ghosts that haunted me behind my smile.  
They werenâ€™t new.  
They were old companions.  
I had lived my whole life dragging them behind me like iron chains,  
pretending they didnâ€™t hurt.

Sometimes, I could forget.  
I could lose myself in chasing the next thing â€” the next dopamine hit,  
the next success story,  
the next distraction shiny enough to make me believe it mattered.

But deep down, some part of me knew:  
I was on the verge of something.  
And it wasnâ€™t success.  
It wasnâ€™t healing.

It was madness.

It was something ancient waking up inside me that I didnâ€™t have a name for yet.  
Something primal.  
Something that didnâ€™t care about my dreams or fears or strategies.

I lived for years like that â€” teetering on the edge of something I couldn't fully see.

Sometimes the DPDR would hit me out of nowhere,  
like the ground had turned into a hologram under my feet.  
Sometimes the tinnitus would howl so loud,  
I swore it wasnâ€™t coming from my ears but from inside my skull itself.  
Sometimes the existential dread would hit me like a freight train,  
leaving me paralyzed in my own living room,  
afraid to even move, afraid the illusion would crack if I breathed too hard.

But I survived each wave.  
I thought survival was proof I was winning.

I didnâ€™t know that survival was just the Matrixâ€™s way of keeping me sedated.  
I didnâ€™t know that the real death was still ahead of me.  
And that I would not survive it in the way I thought.

Looking back, I realize:  
The collapse didnâ€™t come out of nowhere.  
It had been stalking me my whole life.

It showed up in the questions I was too afraid to ask out loud.  
It showed up in the late nights where I stared at the ceiling and felt like the world was a cheap imitation of something real I could almost remember.  
It showed up in the moments of panic when everything around me seemed hollow and no amount of noise could drown it out.

The Matrix was cracking.  
Slowly.  
Quietly.

And I was too busy trying to patch the cracks to realize:  
I was never meant to save the dream.

I was meant to wake up from it.

Everything that came next â€”  
the mindbend, the shotgun visions, the folding of reality into itself â€”  
all of it was the inevitable consequence of a life spent lying to myself about what was real.

I didnâ€™t know it then,  
but I was standing at the edge of the abyss.

And the abyss was starting to look back at me.
