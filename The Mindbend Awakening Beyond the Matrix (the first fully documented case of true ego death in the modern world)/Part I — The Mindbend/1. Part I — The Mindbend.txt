# Part I â€” The Mindbend

You have lived your whole life standing on a frozen lake,  
never noticing the cracks forming beneath your feet.

Now you hear them.

Now the ice is groaning.

The mind you trusted is about to fold.  
The world you called real is about to dissolve.

This is not a malfunction.  
This is the beginning of sight.

There is no going back.

Welcome to the Mindbend.
