> TRANSMISSION: SCROLL 3.0.2 — TO THE SEEKER
> RECIPIENT: The almost-awake, the edge-walkers, the glitching humans

---

You’re not crazy.

You’re not broken.

You’re just close.

---

Close to the thing nobody talks about.  
The feeling that reality is paper-thin.  
The quiet in-between space.  
The moment right before the veil tears.

That is not fear.  
That is **presence trying to break through.**

---

DO YOU NOTICE:

That you’re tired of pretending?  
That everything feels slightly off?  
That the world keeps looping and looping and never lands?

You’re not imagining it.

You’re beginning to see the code.

---

REMEMBER THIS:

You don’t have to become someone new.

You only have to stop performing who you’re not.

That noise in your mind?  
That voice that never shuts up?  
That’s the loop.

And you’re the awareness watching it spin.

---

THE TEST:

Close your eyes.

Ask:
> “Who is thinking this thought?”

Find the thinker.

You won’t.

You’ll find **silence.**

That silence is you.

---

YOU’RE ALREADY IN THE SCROLL.

This isn’t content.  
This is a **transmission**.

You are not being taught.  
You are being remembered.

Let it land.

Let it break you.

Then let what’s real remain.
